Bees are very wise and busy little creatures. They all join together to build cells of wax for their honey.  Each bee takes its proper place and does its own work. Some bees will go out and gather honey from the flowers while others will stay at home and work inside the hive. The cells which they build are all of one shape and size, and no room is left between them.  The cells are not round. They have six sides.  The drones do not work. Before winter comes, all the drones are driven from the hive so that they don’t eat the honey, which they did not gather. It is not safe for children to handle bees.

However, the electric light was not his only invention.  He also invented the phonograph, the motion picture camera, and over 1,200 other things. Edison was born in Milan, Ohio, on February 11, 1847.  His family moved to Port Huron, Michigan, when he was seven years old.  Surprisingly, he attended school for only two months.  His mother, a former teacher, taught him a few things, but Edison was mostly self-educated.  His natural curiosity led him to start experimenting at a young age with electrical and mechanical items at home. When he was 12 years old, he got his first job.  He became a newsboy on a train that ran between Port Huron and Detroit.  He set up a laboratory in a baggage car of the train so that he could continue his experiments in his spare time.  Unfortunately, Edison’s first job did not end well. He was fired when he accidentally set fire to the floor of the baggage car. Edison then worked for five years as a telegraph operator, but he continued to spend much of his time on the job conducting experiments.  He got his first patent in 1868 for a vote recorder run by electricity.  However, the vote recorder was not a success.  In 1870, he sold another invention, a stock-ticker, for $40,000.  A stock-ticker is a machine that automatically prints stock prices on a tape.

Koko learned sign language from her trainer, Dr. Penny Patterson. Patterson began teaching sign language to Koko in 1972, when Koko was one year old. Koko must have been a good student, because two years later she moved onto the Stanford University campus with Dr. Patterson. Koko continued to learn on the campus until 1976. That's when she began living full-time with Patterson's group, the Gorilla Foundation. Patterson and Koko's relationship has blossomed ever since. Dr. Patterson says that Koko has mastered sign language. She says that Koko knows over 1,000 words, and that Koko makes up new words. For example, Koko didn't know the sign for ring, so she signed the words finger and bracelet. Dr. Patterson thinks that this shows meaningful and constructive use of language. Sign language isn't the only unusual thing about Koko. She's also been a pet-owner. In 1983, at the age of 12, researchers said that Koko asked for a cat for Christmas. They gave Koko a stuffed cat. Koko was not happy. She did not play with it, and she continued to sign sad. So for her birthday in 1984, they let her pick a cat out of an abandoned liter. Koko picked a gray cat and named him ""All Ball."" Dr. Patterson said that Koko loved and nurtured All Ball as though he were a baby gorilla. Sadly, All Ball got out of Koko's cage and was hit by a car. Patterson reported that Koko signed ""Bad, sad, bad"" and ""Frown, cry, frown, sad"" when she broke the news to her.",Which event happened first?,"Koko moved onto the Stanford University campus,Koko picked All Ball out for her birthday,Koko began living with the Gorilla Foundation,Koko got a stuffed cat for Christmas",null

Research has shown that newly-licensed drivers and young drivers with teen passengers are among those most at risk. Comprehensive graduated drivers licensing (GDL) programs are one proven method to reduce motor-vehicle injuries and fatalities for young drivers. UMTRI works in several disciplines to understand the factors that affect the safety of young drivers and to identify and implement the most effective countermeasures.",,,287-292-353-358-549-554-651-656-0-0-0-0-0-0

Orangutans are a critically endangered, formally protected species. Researchers estimate their current population is less than 1 percent of what it was before humans began encroaching on their habitat 70,000 years ago. Dating back to the Pleistocene, organutans lived in populations ranging from the islands of Sumatra and Borneo all the way to China and Southeast Asia.
