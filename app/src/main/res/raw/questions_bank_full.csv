Of course, we all have our favorite flavors – and it turns out those favorites differ, on a broader scale, by state. Using Google search volume and data from ice cream shops around the country, a software company, WorkWise, came up with a list of the most popular ice cream flavors in every state. And? Well, there were some trends. Cookies and Cream was the most popular ice cream in 14 states: Delaware, Georgia, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maryland, Minnesota, Mississippi, Missouri, New Mexico, Oklahoma, Rhode Island, South Dakota, Texas and West Virginia. Vanilla was the most popular in five states: Kansas, Maine, Montana, New Hampshire and North Dakota. And notching primo popularity in four states apiece were Chocolate (Alaska, Idaho, Wisconsin and Wyoming), Strawberry (Arkansas, Hawaii, South Carolina and Tennessee) and Peppermint (Indiana, Iowa, Nebraska and North Carolina). While Coconut Milk ice cream was the most-searched-for variety in Oregon, Utah and Washington and Mango was the pick in Arizona and Illinois, many states stood alone in their preferences. Alabama is all about Butter Pecan. Don’t get between Californians and their Tutti Frutti. Colorado has the Rocky Mountains and a taste for Rocky Road. DC is super international with its yen for Stracciatella. Florida likes things sweet; it’s super into Dulce de Leche. Massachusetts prefers Cherry; Nevada, Cotton Candy; New Jersey, Mint Chocolate Chip; New York, Chocolate Chip; Ohio, Pumpkin; and Vermont, Chocolate Chip Cookie Dough. Then there are the head scratchers: Really Connecticut? Beer ice cream? And Michigan, what even is 'Superman' ice cream? Ditto 'Teaberry,' Pennsylvania, and 'Tiger Tail,' Virginia?

2,Reading Comprehension,Visual Cognitive,Accuracy/Timing,CA,Q#,Please read the following passage and then tap Next to answer the question,"In the pantheon of chain-restaurant appetizers, Outback Steakhouse’s Bloomin’ Onion is arguably one of the most revered. But Outback’s most famous 'Aussie-tizer' sets itself apart from the competition thanks to its relative simplicity. Just think about it: At one point in semi-recent history, the recipe development team at Outback Steakhouse wondered if customers would want to eat an entire gosh-darn onion if it was deep-fried. And you know what? We did! Then again, we suppose we’re simplifying it a bit. There’s actually much more to the Bloomin’ Onion’s history. It was created by Outback co-founder Tim Gannon. Tim Gannon based the recipe for one of the soon-to-be-signature appetizers on a dish at a restaurant in New Orleans — not Australia. The Bloomin’ Onion officially hit the menu at the very first Outback Steakhouse location in Tampa in 1988 — the same year the chain debuted. Outback debuted a 'loaded' version in 2016. Not content to merely feed people whole fried onions, Outback Steakhouse debuted a 'loaded' version in 2016. Originally, the offering came topped with french fries, cheese and bacon bits, but grew in subsequent years to include chunks of sirloin steak and, at one point, whole baby back ribs. They used to be cut by hand, but not anymore. For the first few years, Bloomin’ Onions were sliced by hand before being battered and fried — but that all changed with the slicing machine invented exclusively for Outback Steakhouse in 1991. The workers responsible for preparing the dish were apparently so appreciative of the time-saving tool that they nicknamed the cutting apparatus 'Gloria,' Outback Steakhouse tells Fox News. A college senior successfully lobbied Outback to become a Bloomin’ Onion mascot. Jake Sievers, a former senior at Hillsdale College in Michigan, made it his mission to become the official mascot at the Outback Bowl — an annual college football game played between teams from the SEC and Big Ten, and sponsored by Outback Steakhouse. After tweeting at the restaurant chain for more than a year, Sievers was finally granted his wish, becoming the official mascot of the 2020 game and earning the privilege of wearing a Bloomin’ Onion costume. The original recipe is a closely guarded secret. Copycats may try to emulate the recipe, but they’ll never be able to get it quite right. According to Outback, the official recipe is a closely guarded secret. 'The original hand-written recipe is held under lock and key in Outback Research and Development,' a representative for the chain confirmed.",Where did the Bloomin' Onion first appear on the menu?,,null
3,Reading Comprehension,Visual Cognitive,Accuracy/Timing,Abner Doubleday,Q299,Please read the following text and answer the question,"More than 350,000 fans visit the National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum located in Cooperstown, New York, every year. The museum, established in 1939, is located in the very town where Abner Doubleday was said to have designed the game approximately 100 years prior. Cooperstown is home to less than 2,000 people in Central New York. Cooperstown is located in Otsego County and is also home to the Farmer's Museum. If a map of New York State was placed on a dart board, Cooperstown would be the bull’s-eye. Great baseball players, such as Babe Ruth and Ted Williams, are honored in life size woodcarvings in the Hall of Fame Gallery. The Cooperstown Room traces the history and development of baseball. Displays of women in baseball, the All Star Game, and world tours can be found on the museums second floor. Each year new players are inducted into the Hall of Fame. The process of selection is highly competitive. Players can be inducted by either the Baseball Writers Association of America or the Veterans Committee. The Baseball Writers Association of America is composed of journalists who write for newspapers, magazines, and credentialed web sites. The Veterans Committee consists of veteran and retired professional baseball executives, managers, players, and umpires. Any player who has 10 years professional baseball experience is eligible to be inducted into the Cooperstown Hall. You cannot be considered until you have been retired for a full 5 years.

The region surrounding the trench is noteworthy for many unique environments. The Mariana Trench contains the deepest known points on Earth, vents bubbling up liquid sulfur and carbon dioxide, active mud volcanoes and marine life adapted to pressures 1,000 times that at sea level. The Challenger Deep, in the southern end of the Mariana Trench, is the deepest spot in the ocean. Its depth is difficult to measure from the surface, but modern estimates vary by less than 1,000 feet. In 2010, the Challenger Deep was pegged at 36,070 feet, as measured with sound pulses sent through the ocean during a 2010 survey by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). In 2012, film director and deep-sea explorer James Cameron descended to the bottom of Challenger Deep, briefly reaching 35,756 feet during the 2012 expedition. But he could have gone a little deeper. A high-resolution seafloor mapping survey published in 2014 by researchers from the University of New Hampshire said the Challenger Deep bottoms out at 36,037 feet. By comparison, Mount Everest stands at 29,026 feet above sea level, meaning the deepest part of the Mariana Trench is 7,044 feet deeper than Everest is tall.",In what year did James Cameron descend to the bottom of Challenger Deep?,,readcomp14

The other half of the year, the Norwegian archipelago is plunged into the purple darkness of polar night. Few people have heard of Svalbard and even fewer have seen it. The isolated group of islands is an old mining settlement turned glacial adventuring outpost located 1,200 miles north of the Norwegian capital, and is one of the closest landmasses to the North Pole, along with Greenland and Nunavut. There are more polar bears than people. Svalbard is an Arctic desert. Its permafrost makes it the ideal home for the Global Seed Vault, an underground repository for the world’s most vital crops (and likely Svalbard’s most famous tourist attraction, though no tourists are allowed inside).

(AP) — An animal control company in Virginia said it’s removed an 8-foot-long beehive from someone’s apartment. Virginia Wildlife Management and Control said in a statement that they removed the hive from the ceiling of a living room in Richmond on Monday. The space was in between tenants at the time. The company said the hive produced about 80 to 100 pounds of honey, although only about 15 to 20 pounds was able to be salvaged. Rich Perry, owner of the wildlife control company, told The Charlotte Observer that the hive was big enough to support 100,000 to 150,000 bees. But he said it wasn’t fully occupied. Perry said it was extremely unusual to find such a large hive inside a building. He said the hive of Italian bees was likely to be at least 2 years old. He said the bees probably got in through holes in the siding and found a home between rafters and sheet rock. The company said it has a “no kill” policy with bees.

However, the electric light was not his only invention.  He also invented the phonograph, the motion picture camera, and over 1,200 other things. Edison was born in Milan, Ohio, on February 11, 1847.  His family moved to Port Huron, Michigan, when he was seven years old.  Surprisingly, he attended school for only two months.  His mother, a former teacher, taught him a few things, but Edison was mostly self-educated.  His natural curiosity led him to start experimenting at a young age with electrical and mechanical items at home. When he was 12 years old, he got his first job.  He became a newsboy on a train that ran between Port Huron and Detroit.  He set up a laboratory in a baggage car of the train so that he could continue his experiments in his spare time.  Unfortunately, Edison’s first job did not end well. He was fired when he accidentally set fire to the floor of the baggage car. Edison then worked for five years as a telegraph operator, but he continued to spend much of his time on the job conducting experiments.  He got his first patent in 1868 for a vote recorder run by electricity.  However, the vote recorder was not a success.  In 1870, he sold another invention, a stock-ticker, for $40,000.  A stock-ticker is a machine that automatically prints stock prices on a tape.

Koko learned sign language from her trainer, Dr. Penny Patterson. Patterson began teaching sign language to Koko in 1972, when Koko was one year old. Koko must have been a good student, because two years later she moved onto the Stanford University campus with Dr. Patterson. Koko continued to learn on the campus until 1976. That's when she began living full-time with Patterson's group, the Gorilla Foundation. Patterson and Koko's relationship has blossomed ever since. Dr. Patterson says that Koko has mastered sign language. She says that Koko knows over 1,000 words, and that Koko makes up new words. For example, Koko didn't know the sign for ring, so she signed the words finger and bracelet. Dr. Patterson thinks that this shows meaningful and constructive use of language. Sign language isn't the only unusual thing about Koko. She's also been a pet-owner. In 1983, at the age of 12, researchers said that Koko asked for a cat for Christmas. They gave Koko a stuffed cat. Koko was not happy. She did not play with it, and she continued to sign sad. So for her birthday in 1984, they let her pick a cat out of an abandoned liter. Koko picked a gray cat and named him ""All Ball."" Dr. Patterson said that Koko loved and nurtured All Ball as though he were a baby gorilla. Sadly, All Ball got out of Koko's cage and was hit by a car. Patterson reported that Koko signed ""Bad, sad, bad"" and ""Frown, cry, frown, sad"" when she broke the news to her.",Which event happened first?,"Koko moved onto the Stanford University campus,Koko picked All Ball out for her birthday,Koko began living with the Gorilla Foundation,Koko got a stuffed cat for Christmas",null

Pesticides are over-applied by many backyard gardeners, said James Dill, a pest management specialist. 'They don’t read the labels, or they eyeball the amounts.' Dill said. But well-informed gardeners can be a big help in reversing the pollinator declines. 'Avoid spraying plants that are in bloom and use pesticides with low toxicity to bees and other beneficial insects.' Buckley said. 'Whether as a farmer or a homeowner, it is critical to always follow the label.' If you keep bees, finding the right apiary location is an important way to reduce pesticide exposure. Supplying honeybees with uncontaminated water is also an effective deterrent. 'If the bees do not have a water source in the apiary, they will be forced to look for water elsewhere during the hot months,' [Kevin] Jensen said. 'This can result in bees being attracted to an area that is being sprayed, even though that area may not have flowers blooming in it.' Even pesticides allowed for use in organic agriculture can harm bees and other beneficial insects, entomologists say. 'Homeowners should avoid using pesticides in backyards and instead use nontoxic methods such as soapy water to get rid of pests.' Said Ramesh Sagili, an associate professor of apiculture.","True or false, honey bees are the insect most impacted by pesticide contamination of lawns, gardens, and waterways","True,False",readcomp3

Reading challenges your brain differently than watching TV or listening to music. Parts of the brain that have developed for other functions (e.g., vision, language, and associative learning) connect in a unique neural circuit for reading. 2. Reading could lengthen exercise time. Bring a good book to the gym to keep you on an exercise machine longer. Exercise physiologists recommend that in order to avoid neck or shoulder pain, readers should use the machine’s book ledge and try not to round their shoulders while working out. 3. Reading keeps your brain young. In a recent study, adults who spent their downtime reading had a 32% slower rate of cognitive decline later in life than those who did not read. 'Reading increases brain efficiency by changing its structure to continue functioning properly (in spite of age-related brain diseases),' a professor of neuropsychology said. Older adults who regularly read are 2.5 times less likely to develop Alzheimer’s disease. Reading also decreases levels of stress hormones such as cortisol. 4. Reading boosts your vocabulary. Researchers estimate that we learn 5-15% of our entire vocabulary through reading. This is particularly important for children, whose vocabulary size is dramatically related to the books they read. 5. Reading could help you save cash. The average novel costs about $11 and takes ~6 hours to read. Compare that to going to see a few movies or eating a few meals out. Reading could be more cost-effective for your entertainment dollars.

The whales are highly sensitive to noise; they depend on sound for communication, detection of prey, and navigation. Producing among the loudest underwater sounds, earthquakes can induce injuries, hearing damage, displacement, and subsequent behavioral modifications. Though rare, earthquakes can shift the state of ecosystems. A recent 7.8 magnitude earthquake triggered widespread underwater mudslides in an underwater canyon off the New Zealand coastline, an important foraging ground for sperm whales. High-energy currents swept 850 tonnes of sediment from the underwater canyon into the ocean. Scientists examined the behavior of 54 sperm whales over four years. The whales' behavior changed in the year following the earthquake lasted about a year after. There are two possible reasons. First, benthic invertebrate communities which lived in the canyon may have been removed by the canyon flushing event, resulting in sparser prey. Second, the change in sediment distribution may have required sperm whales to re-learn their habitat. 'The changed seabed probably means a short supply of food for the animals normally feeding there. This shift would indirectly affect the presence of the prey of sperm whales (deep-water fish and squid), making it harder for the whales to find food.' Said the researchers. 'Deep-sea systems are so hidden that we rarely consider the consequences of them being disturbed, whether by natural or human impacts.'","True or false, earthquakes can shift the state of ecosystems","True,False",null

But why it works remains a mystery. Researchers fed one group of mice a high-fat, high-cholesterol diet with nobiletin. Another group was fed the same diet without nobiletin. Those fed nobiletin were markedly leaner and had reduced levels of insulin resistance and blood fats compared to those without nobiletin. 'We can intervene with nobiletin,' said a professor (who has researched nobiletin's effects for 10+ years). 'Nobelitin can reverse the negative symptoms in mice and can reverse build-up in the arteries.' The professor and his team have not yet pinpointed exactly how nobiletin works. They hypothesize that the molecule acts on the enzymes that regulate how fat is handled in the body. While the mystery remains, this result is still clinically important: nobiletin won't interfere with other prescription drugs that affect these systems. The next step is to move these studies into humans to determine if nobiletin has the same positive metabolic effects in human trials.

It’s mainly older women who respond to the call, making their way out of the mud-brick homes of Askaoun village and into the fields of saffron flowers. With aching backs and hands blistered by the morning cold, they sing and chat as they pick the flower. The women must work quickly and steadily: the saffron plants bloom for only 2 weeks a year and the flowers become worthless if they blossom. The flowers’ stigmas must be picked out and dried within a few hours of harvest. Otherwise, their value drops drastically. Each step is done by hand, making saffron harvest one of the most laborious agricultural activities. The weather can also devastate the village’s livelihood: this year, the precipitation was irregular, the snow scarce, and the cold period too brief. Askaoun village depends solely on the saffron harvest to survive (other crops cannot grow in the arid soil). However, the village sees only a fraction of the money spent by consumers of the spice.

'I have had to overcome it so many times so now I am pretty used to getting that feeling,' said Harlaut, who is the most decorated male big air X Games competitor of all time. 'I just feed myself with as much confidence as I can before I do it, that’s the main thing. You have to really believe you are going to be able to pull it off. If you don’t believe it you might as well try another day.' The 28-year-old was introduced to freestyle skiing 19 years ago. It is fair to say the pursuit of new tricks has become something of an obsession ever since.  And as the flips, twists and grabs have become ever more complicated, so the Swede has had to adjust his approach. 'I used to do a lot of trampolining but now since the tricks are so big I don’t get enough airtime on a trampoline,' Harlaut explained with a grin. 'So it’s almost more crazy for me to do it on a trampoline than on skis.' It is no surprise that Harlaut values two skills most of all when it comes to advising keen young wannabes on how to get to the top in freestyle. 'You need quite a good ski background, just to be able to have good edge control to get into the jump nicely and land nicely,' he said. 'And then somewhat of an acrobatic edge. You need to have spent some time doing trampoline or something and getting air awareness.' Harlaut has added joyful dedication to this package, and it has paid off handsomely.

Warm winters have cut into ice wine production recently. The German Wine Institute said that none of the country’s wine regions saw the necessary low temperature of -7◦C (19◦F). In 2017, only 7 producers managed to make it; only 5 managed in 2013. According to the Institute, the most recent harvest was the likely first one to create no ice wine since its production began in 1830. Freezing the grapes before they are crushed concentrates the sugar and leads to an intensely sweet, golden wine often served with dessert.  Workers must race into the vineyards to bring the grapes in with only a few hours’ notice when the temperature falls, often at night or in the early morning. Since the grapes must be pressed while still frozen, winemakers labor in unheated facilities. Vineyard owners also face the risk that grapes set aside for ice wine will rot on the vine before the hard freeze comes. Ice wine has always been a niche product with around 0.1% of German production, and expensive due to low volumes. Production of ice wine has the potential to increase a winemaker’s reputation. Canada’s Niagara Peninsula is one of several other places where ice wine is produced, thanks to its cold winters.

After six years, the results are in. 'I was surprised at how little these cats moved,' says lead author Roland Kays of the North Carolina Museum of Natural Sciences. 'Most of them spent all their time within 100 meters of their yard.' Katniss Everdeen was a typical participant. Like most cats in the study, she mainly stayed around her house and in the forested lot behind it.

Until about 500BC, when Greek scientists became able to predict an eclipse of the sun, people couldn't know when or why exactly they would happen.

It turns out that Luzon, the largest island in the Philippines, holds this honorable prize. Their 15-year study concluded that out of 56 species of mammals (not including bats) on the island, a staggering 52 were found to be endemic. With 93% of its non-flying mammals found nowhere else on Earth, Luzon is a biological treasure trove. With lots of space and across lots of time, Luzon has given any colonizing animals just the right ingredients to adapt and evolve into new species. For animals that swam across from other islands or were swept over on rafts of mangroves or palm trees, it was the perfect opportunity not only to adapt into new species themselves but then for these new species to diversify into yet more species. From unusual mice that mainly hunt and eat earthworms, to other rodents with long elegant whiskers stretching the entire length of their bodies, Luzon is an incredible example of island evolution.",What percentage of Luzon's non-flying mammals are not found anywhere else on Earth?,,readcomp21

More than 15 zany events and 100 other activities are found at Alaska’s largest and oldest winter festival, Anchorage Fur Rendezvous. Known locally as Fur Rondy, the event has been going strong since before statehood. The event started in 1935 as a three-day sporting event timed to coincide with the return of miners and trappers loaded down with the fruits of a winter of work. The original event featured skiing, hockey, basketball, boxing, and a children's sled dog race down Fourth Avenue. Sports are still a big part of Anchorage Fur Rendezvous, but sprinting before reindeer or steering the fastest outhouse on skis put Rondy in a league of its own for competitive spirit. Fan favorites like the Outhouse Races and Running of the Reindeer, a mad dash down the streets of Anchorage with caribou at the racers’ heels, always draws a crowd. In the Rondy World Championship Sled Dog Races, dog teams and their mushers complete a high-speed loop daily for three days with the fastest time the winner. The competition, which began in 1946, is considered the grandfather of all Alaska races.",Which competition is considered the grandfather of all Alaska races?,,null
